* **Team** : Adrian Alva, Subramanyam Makam, Yahnit Sirineni

* **Client** : RaviKiran ,Golive games, CIE, IIIT Hyderabad

* **Description of the project** :
- This project seeks to understand user/player behavior from their analytics data and create a model based on which the application can trigger offers to help them progress in the game. 
- The project tries to extract relevant variables from the data which can help in identifying the stages at which offer triggers are most probable to generate revenue. 
- The stakeholders directly affected by this project are the game's players and the game's administrators. 
- The project also tries to classify players, games and offers into categories so that offers for each type of player and game can be triggered in the most effective way.
- The project is implemented as various modules and sub-modules each doing seperate independent tasks like classifying the user, checking offer eligibility, creating offers, and generating offers with store items.
- The project implementation can be used for a variety of games, the primary reason being that the concepts used to describe player characteristics are general enough.
- The only two external specification required for the project to be incorporated into a game are the JSON files containing the offer classifications which list the valid offers, and the list of store items.
