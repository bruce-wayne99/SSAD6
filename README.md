This project seeks to understand user/player behavior from their analytics data and create a model based on which the application can trigger offers to help them progress in the game. The project tries to extract relevant variables from the data which can help in identifying the stages at which offer triggers are most probable to generate revenue. The stakeholders directly affected by this project are the game's players and the game's administrators. The project also tries to classify players, games and offers into categories so that offers for each type of player and game can be triggered in the most effective way.
